description: Terms of Service for Raspy Bot
---

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Raspy (the "Bot"), a Discord bot designed for Emergency Response: Liberty County (ER:LC). By installing, using, or interacting with Raspy, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use Raspy. This Bot is not affiliated with or endorsed by Discord Inc. or Roblox Corporation.

Description of Service
Raspy provides server utility functions for Discord servers focused on ER:LC gameplay. These include moderation tools, server management commands, in-game economy features, and Roblox integration through noblox.js. Raspy is made for use across multiple servers and may be used in public or private Discord communities. Features may be updated, changed, or removed at any time.

Eligibility and Age
You must be at least 13 years old to use Raspy. If you are located in a country that sets a higher digital age of consent, such as 16 years in some European Union member states, you must meet that minimum age or obtain parental or guardian consent. By using Raspy, you represent that you meet these requirements.

Acceptable Use
You agree to use Raspy only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. The following conduct is prohibited:

Violating local, national, or international laws

Using Raspy to engage in harassment, abuse, hate speech, or discrimination

Sharing explicit, illegal, or harmful content through the Bot

Spamming or exploiting the Bot’s systems

Attempting to reverse-engineer, tamper with, or disrupt Raspy or its databases

Using Raspy for impersonation, fraud, or cheating

We reserve the right to suspend or permanently ban any user or server that violates these rules.

Data Collection and GDPR Compliance
Raspy collects and processes limited personal data in order to function properly. This includes:

Discord user IDs and usernames

Roblox usernames and IDs (if linked)

IP addresses (when interacting with web services)

Command usage logs and other metadata

Raspy complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Data is collected only when necessary to provide the service, secure it, and improve functionality. No personal data is sold or shared with third parties. Data is stored securely and only retained for as long as necessary. You have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data. For any data inquiries, contact the support team as listed below.

Premium Features and Payments
Raspy offers optional premium features through paid subscriptions. These may include extended functionality, priority support, and customization options.

By subscribing to premium services, you agree to:

Pay recurring subscription fees as advertised

Authorize automatic billing through the chosen payment processor

Cancel your subscription through the provided method if you no longer wish to be charged

All payments are processed by a third-party provider. We do not store payment card information. No refunds will be given for unused time unless required by law.

Intellectual Property
The Raspy bot, including its codebase and features, is the intellectual property of its developers. All rights are reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, alter, or distribute the Bot’s functionality without written permission, except where otherwise allowed (for example, open-source dependencies like noblox.js, which is MIT licensed).

Limitation of Liability
Raspy is provided “as is” and “as available.” No guarantees are made regarding uptime, accuracy, or performance. We disclaim all warranties, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We are not liable for damages resulting from use or inability to use Raspy. Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid for premium services, or one euro if no payment has been made.

Prohibited Behavior
You agree not to:

Harass or exploit other users through the Bot

Share hateful, extremist, or illegal content

Use cheats, scripts, or exploits within the Bot’s systems

Abuse the economy or impersonate other users

Circumvent bans, restrictions, or security measures

We may immediately suspend or revoke access for any user or server that violates these prohibitions.

Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access to Raspy at any time, for any reason, with or without notice. Termination may result in the deletion of associated data, including account records and stored preferences. If you have an active premium plan, termination does not guarantee a refund unless required by law.

Changes to These Terms
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Updates will be posted through our support server or website. Continued use of Raspy after such changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically.

Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of a European Union member state, such as Ireland or the Netherlands. Any disputes shall be resolved under the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that region.

Contact
To exercise your data rights, submit complaints, or ask questions regarding these Terms, contact the development team via our support Discord server or email: [Insert Contact Email].

By using Raspy, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by these Terms.
